# Cotuber
_A very very simple PNGTuber_  

Why make a PNGTUber? I thought that would be a simple, fun and fast project to make.  

All that a PNGTuber needs to do is change the image whenever the user start/stop speaking, nothing complicated... Until I noticed that Godot only receive inputs while the window is focused. Which makes sense, listening to global inputs can be very dangerous, and it's not something that games normally need.  

After learning a little more about operating system, I was able to make an addon to solve this problem ([OSShortcut](https://github.com/thiagola92/os-shortcut)). With this I'm closing this little side project that took me a lot of time but taught a lot about operating systems.
